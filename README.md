# Blogging site with Django
In this project I take my inspiration from medium and try to build a similar blogging site.
Users can read as well as write blogs.<br> User can follow bloggers and request for notifications from a blogger. Users can as well email bloggers.
The site is a work in progress as I am yet to create user accounts and make all links work. It is fully responsive and designs changed depending on the screen size.
I have included a requirements files which contains all installations required for this site. Image display is still a problem but I'll be working on it soon.
For the backend I feel it is working great. I used class based views, since they save alot of time and reduce the number of code lines.
When complete users should be able to blog either on the admin site or via email. 

# How to run the project
1. Make an empty directory and open it in your terminal<br>
2. create a virtual enviroment and activate it<br>
3. clone the this repository into the folder<br>
4. install django and the requirements file<br>
5. cd into folder containing the manage.py file<br>
6. run python3 manage.py runserver<br>
